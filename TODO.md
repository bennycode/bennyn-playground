TODOs

- Split UserBuilder into UserBuilder & "User Service" (for API Calls)
- Create a "Conversation Service"
- Define a centralized object that keeps the url structure (Zeta.Backend.Service.URLs?)
- Define an object that caches the user, the conversations and other states 
- For calls that need an access token check first if there is an access token... If not... require one or show a warning!
